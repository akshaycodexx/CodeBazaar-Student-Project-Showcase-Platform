✅ CodeBazaar Project – Problem Statement & Solution


---

🔴 Problem Statement

In India, lakhs of college students build coding projects every year—many of them impressive—but most projects:

Get lost after submission.

Don’t help the student get noticed.

Can’t be reused or monetized.

Lack proper documentation and deployment.

Don’t reach recruiters or juniors who want to learn.


There is no unified platform where:

Students can upload their projects with proper setup guides, video tutorials, and live demos.

Other learners or developers can download, learn from, or even buy projects.

Recruiters can find quality student developers based on real work.

Hackathon organizers can discover talent and manage events.

Students can earn money from their projects.
